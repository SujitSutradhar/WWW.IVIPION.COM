        <h3>song of VICTORY</h3>
    <br>
  Rings only in my heart the call of the empty mind that where you sing the winning song of the praised life.<br>
What i've all accumulated wealth in this life will everything be over in this world. And it will be heard only this winning song of you at the end of time.
<br>
WHEN i returned home taking the taste of everything in the world, i felt then boiled,non boiled, sour, sweet and bitter things what kill the taste of the mind.
<br>
I Saw rivers and deserts, hills and dales, seas and beaches and saw beautious mansions by wandering a long while with my desired emotion! But i have't heard anywhere this winning song by wandering the entire world for long.
<br>
Now the world is about to be the abandoned land and until you sing the song to my ears i will fast for the thirst of my soul for long.</<p>
